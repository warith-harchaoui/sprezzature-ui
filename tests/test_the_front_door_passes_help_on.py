"""
test_the_front_door_passes_help_on — `sprezzature-ui TOOL --help` is the tool's help.

The front door registers each tool as a sub-command that forwards its
arguments. With a help option of its own, that stub answered `--help` with
one line and a REST argument, and only `TOOL -- --help` reached the flags
anybody was asking about.
